EWC Proxy is simple!

In a console, just do:

perl ./ewcproxy_v2.pl

And then in your IRC client, do:

/server 127.0.0.1 7000

And it will connect to the EWC server, handling authentication for you 
and masquerading as Rambler (EWC's Flash IRC client). 

Caveat: it will cheat your IRC Client into thinking it has absolutely
no lag. I haven't yet found a way to work around this (possibly
use CTCP PING on the server end and translate it back to PING/PONG)

Enjoy!
